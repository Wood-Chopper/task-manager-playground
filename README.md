# Task List Sandbox

This project is the starting point of any dev or article that needs a demonstration. This repo aims to be a ready-to-use project to test any development, create tutorials, do researches etc.

The master branch is the base branch. I don't know yet if I will evolve the master branch with the specific dev or if I will create separate branches for each specific dev.

## Base state of the application:

The application allows you to store multiple task lists. A very simple feature.

The `angular` folder contains the frontend application. The architecture enforce the loose coupling principle.

The `spring` folder contains the backend application. It uses an implementation of the Onion Architecture.

Some other technologies may be added to this repo. I am considering adding a .NET version of the backend for learning purpose.
